# About Me
The name is Sean but you'll commonly hear me referred to online as Metal Face. I’m a software engineer by day and a hacker of all things by night. I love tinkering and learning new things but most of all, I love a good challenge. I have a lot of experience with web application programing and have worked as a full stack engineer most of my career. I’m always looking to network so don’t hesitate to reach out using the contact info below!
